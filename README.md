# Berlin-Clock-Kata

@authors: PHAM Van-Huy && GAVIRIA Christian

Due to some problems related to our phpunit version, we couldn't work with the pair programming methodology as expected. 
Instead, we worked on one PC and swapped roles every ~25 minutes thanks to the share control option on Teams.

Conventions used for the Berlin's clock:
"O": Light off
"R": Light red on
"Y": Light yellow on

The format used for the translation to the full Berlin's clock is the following: seconds_blockOf5hours_simpleHours_blockOf5minutes_simpleMinutes
